# Simulating Self Driving_Cars Effects On Traffic Congestion

Advanced self-driving cars can positively impact traffic congestion, utilizing V2V technology. To understand and study the effects in more detail, it is necessary to simulate V2V communication amongst self-driving cars. Work has previously been done, studying the effects of self-driving cars without V2V communication, looking for efficient traffic light policies. My simulation simulates self-driving cars which use V2V communication, to see if it helps with traffic congestion and flow. This is an important topic because traffic congestion increases vehicle emissions which contribute to global warming, as well as wasting peoplesâ€™ time.

The main script RespawnTest.py, is the code that defines the road network which the cars simulate one, as well as the code and paramteres which start the experiment.
